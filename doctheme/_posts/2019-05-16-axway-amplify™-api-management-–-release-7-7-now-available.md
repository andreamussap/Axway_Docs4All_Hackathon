# Axway AMPLIFY™ API Management – Release 7.7 Now Available.

Integration continues to be a key enabler - or inhibitor - for business innovation in every organization. A new set of capabilities are emerging, while others are maturing, to power traditional integration patterns (e.g. files, transactions, messages) and new API/Microservices to work together in the rapid creation of new applications and solutions. These are being characterized by analysts as Hybrid Integration. Chris made this comment! :-)

Axway is at the forefront of Hybrid Integration with our AMPLIFY platform. The value in this platform approach is to enable new stakeholders (e.g. ad-hoc integrators, LOB users, and partners) to quickly discover, try and put into production solutions that integrate and extend their systems and customer experiences, all under the control and policies governed by IT. The AMPLIFY platform capabilities provide a powerful add-on foundation to AMPLIFY API Management v7.7. It enables a central management control plane called AMPLIFY Central that enables you to control and manage API traffic and across multiple service mesh running in different clouds from on-premises to AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure. AMPLIFY Central provides centralized policy management and traffic monitoring and usage analytics. Additionally, the AMPLIFY platform provides the Unified Catalog where teams can share the services and manage the consumption of those services across all the service meshes.

Axway is pleased to announce the 7.7 release of Axway AMPLIFY™ API Management, which includes API Gateway 7.7, API Manager 7.7 and API Portal 7.7.

For PDG Invent Hackathon 2019 a group of us are working on ways to enable anyone (technical or non-technical) to contribute directly to documentation.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Pellentesque nec nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat. Egestas quis ipsum suspendisse ultrices gravida dictum fusce. Rhoncus urna neque viverra justo nec ultrices dui sapien eget. Cras adipiscing enim eu turpis egestas pretium. 

Netlify is nice as it let's you see the final result and can use rich text or markdown in this editor.

Some of you will also receive invites shortly from netlify.com inviting you to create a user on http://hopeful-jennings-7da6b5.netlify.com. 

If you get this invite please follow the [steps in this link](<https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Docs4all+Hackathon+2019+user+testing#Docs4allHackathon2019usertesting-Option2-TesttheNetlifyCMSworkflow(Inviteonly) .>).

Please don’t forget to complete the NPS survey at the end of each workflow! We’ll take a snapshot of NPS from the surveys at 8 am Dublin time on Friday 17th May, but you can continue to try out the flows after this time.

Thanks in advance for your help!

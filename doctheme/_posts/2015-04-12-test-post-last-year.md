**This is just a test post from the previous year.**

In Q1, we had many customer events and meeting to present our updated AMPLIFY offer. Several customers raised interest to have closer relationship, to explain us how they are using our products so we can better anticipate their needs, to better understand how we work. 2 examples among others: Banco ITAU on API, Mercadona on Automator.

Such kind of exchanges will generate great benefits on both side.

We decided to launch an official “Meet with Engineering” Program, inviting customers to visit our engineering office, share their usage of our products, their challenges and directions. On our side we will share insight on our development processes, how we manage subjects like quality or security.

Depending on product used, customer will have to select a different location to visit.

More details in attached document (sample agenda, product and contact for each location).

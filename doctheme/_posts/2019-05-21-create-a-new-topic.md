I wonder what happens when I create a new topic here.

Some questions:

* How do I create a topic without first publishing an existing topic?
* What does the final output look like?
* Is this open to internal users only?
* What about adding comments to a topic (rather than modifying the body)?
* In what way is this more useful than a wiki approach to collaborative content?

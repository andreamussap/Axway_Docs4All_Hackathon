# Axway Docs as code - Hackathon 2019 project

ReadMeFirst, Axway doc team, are looking for alternatives to allow contribution to our docs.

This is a project for the PDG Invent 2019 - Hackathon with Phoenix, Dublin, and Grenoble offices.

## About the project

Use markdown, Github, Jekyll, Netlify/Netlify CMS to implement a **docs as code** approach and evaluate it as a solution for opening up our docs to internal (and later external) communities, both for engineers and non-technical contributors.

## Team members

- Alex Earnshaw
- Andrea Mussap
- Natalia Oreshkina
- Uzair Ali 

## We manage our project using Mural
